# cmsc614-kernel-level-rootkit

This is a Linux rootkit, largely based on the tutorials by https://xcellerator.github.io. 

The rootkit intercepts file I/O activity and sends it via ssh to an "attacker". 

This is done for education purposes only, and should not be used for any nefarious means. The authors of this repo bear no responsibility should this repo be used for malicious purposes. 

The full code can be found in the dev branch.
